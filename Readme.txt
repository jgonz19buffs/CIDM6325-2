Assignment 2

Online Shop Plus
    Chapters 8 to 11 work with eCommerce by using Django to create an online shop. Note that it is possible to create digital goods rather than physical goods. Thus, we have two possible integrations to continue our Recipe business:
    Sell subscriptions that grant access to extended content regarding recipes
    Sell recipe books
    There are other possible integrations to include Recipes, but the intent is the same: extend what Antonio does with extra things of our own.

Instructions

    Extend the Blog/Bookmarks +Recipe application by modifying the Online Shop project so that shop deals with the Recipes concept.  

    Your task is to extend the Online Shop and also combine all of the existing and Recipe-related apps into one new unified single project space (just as with the previous assignment):
        Blog +
        Bookmarks +
        Online  Shop +

Deliverables
    Create a GitHub repository that houses the completed Django code and share the URL to the repository here with me
    ZIP up the contents of your project directory and upload that here
