This is assignment 1 for CIDM 6325. It expands the recipes by adding image bookmarking.

Instructions
1.	Extend the Blog/Recipe application further by modifying the image bookmarking so that the bookmarks reflect images that correspond to the recipes.  
2.	For this, you will rely on my suggesting to create a type/category Recipe Sharing system ALONGSIDE the Blog. 
3.	I would strongly recommend that you use the Choices feature available within Django models to implement the types/categories for the recipes.  
4.	I also think that you could maybe differentiate Recipes from Blogs by adding additional model elements as recipes tend to have sections whereas blogs are just text (and perhaps images).
5.	Thus, you are extending the image bookmarking by allowing the image bookmarks to carry the additional association with a given recipe and/or recipe type.  
6.	Of course, you don't have to use a choice field or type at all if you use Django Taggit, but I am open to either approach.
